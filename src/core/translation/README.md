# Translation core

This directory owns FluentRead's DOM-to-translation-candidate policy. Callers
outside the directory import `public.ts`; WXT treats a directory-level
`index.ts` as an entrypoint, so this package intentionally has no `index.ts`.

## Pipeline

1. `dom.ts` applies non-overridable safety guards and composed-tree helpers.
2. `registry.ts` compiles the shared site-adaptation JSON catalog into typed
   adapters for the current URL; custom rules use the same compiler.
3. `engine.ts` resolves adapter decisions and generic layout boundaries.
4. `text.ts` extracts readable source text and rejects identifiers/target text.
5. `serialization.ts` prepares safe rich-text input for providers.
6. `src/features/full-page-translation/content/runtime.ts` is the runtime port
   for scheduling, provider requests and rendering. Hover and full-page
   translation both enter through the same
   `TranslationCandidateCore` and the same `translateTarget` function.

## Decision model

Adapters can return `pass`, `skip-self`, `prune-subtree` or `force-target`.
Safety guards (extension-owned DOM, scripts/styles, form inputs, editable or
hidden trees, `translate=no`, SVG/math and similar non-prose content) run before
adapter targets and cannot be reopened. Adapters are sorted by priority, while
registration order is stable for ties. Invalid selectors only invalidate that
match and never abort the page scan.

An adapter may set `genericCandidatePolicy` to `targets-only` when a site has a
large application shell and a stable content allowlist. This disables generic
block and inline-run fallbacks for that matched site while preserving explicit
`force-target` decisions for both hover and full-page translation.

Use `keepOriginal` for protected content that must survive rich-text handling,
and `omitFromTranslation` for metadata that must also be absent from the bilingual
copy. The original page node remains untouched in both cases. Icon-font glyphs
are excluded from provider input and bilingual copies based on their live primary
font family; ordinary prose with an icon font only in its fallback list is kept.
Scribble/Racket code tables marked `table.RktBlk` are protected as code, while
ordinary tables and prose remain eligible. Code blocks remain protected, except
for the browser's direct body `pre` in a `text/plain` document, where that element
is the readable document itself.
Ubuntu HTML manpages preserve command signatures and command labels using the
manual's section structure. Literal command and argument markup stays original
inside translated explanations; these rules apply only to Ubuntu's manpage URLs.
The JSON compiler maps `omit` to metadata omission and `literalLabels` to a
conservative command-label predicate. Both remain editable through ordinary
same-ID custom replacement; no parallel site-specific TypeScript registry is kept.

Every accepted candidate includes a reason and optional adapter id. This keeps
hover/full equality and adapter precedence directly testable without starting a
browser. Open Shadow DOM is traversed through the same policy.

Buttons and elements with `role=button` or `role=menuitem` own their internal
labels, including labels styled as flex or grid boxes. They use the control text
slot path in both display modes, keeping a single visible label within the
original button height and preserving icons, click handlers and restoration.
Internal layout wrappers must not become bilingual paragraphs or synthetic runs.
A mutation scan starting at an internal label resolves back to the control;
protected subtrees still retain their original exclusion boundaries.

## Verification contract

`tests/translationCore.test.ts` covers generic and adapter decisions;
`tests/translationControlOwnership.test.ts` covers nested control labels and
the reusable `tests/fixtures/translation-pages/button-controls.html` fixture.
The real
site contract lives in `tests/browser-translation-cases.json` and is executed by
`scripts/run-site-translation-test.cjs` or
`scripts/run-site-translation-matrix.cjs`. A required case must pass both hover
and full-page translation, restore its original DOM, translate again without
duplicate/nested wrappers, preserve forbidden DOM and keep interactions stable.

Reference projects were studied for traversal and test ideas only. The code in
this directory is an independent FluentRead implementation; site selectors are
kept minimal and backed by FluentRead regression cases instead of copying an
external rule database.
