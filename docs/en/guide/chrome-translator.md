# Use Chrome’s local translation

Chrome’s built-in translation uses an on-device model. Check that your browser supports the language pair and prepare its model before translating.

<GuideVisual kind="chrome-local" en />

## Prepare a language pair

1. Open **Settings → General → Translation providers** and choose **Chrome built-in translation** for webpages. Confirm your source and target languages.
2. Open its **Configure connection** page and choose **Prepare Chrome translation**.
3. Keep settings open while the model downloads.
4. Return to the webpage and retry translation.

Preparation applies to the current language pair. Another pair may need its own preparation. If automatic source detection fails, specify the source language and retry.

## Why is it unavailable?

Availability depends on Chrome version, device, browser policy, language, and download status. Not every computer supports every language. Check your connection and browser updates; use another service if preparation is unavailable.

Initial downloads require a network connection. A language that has not been prepared is not yet ready for offline use.
