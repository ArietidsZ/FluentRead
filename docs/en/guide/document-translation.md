# Document translation

Import a document to read alongside its translation, edit passages as needed and download the result.

<GuideVisual kind="document" en />

## Open your file

Choose **Document translation** in the extension menu and drop a file onto the page, or use the file picker.

For an online PDF such as [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762), open the extension menu and choose **Open PDF reader** or **Document translation**. You can also paste a direct PDF link on the document page. Browser PDF viewers restrict content scripts, so FluentRead opens the original file in its own reader without changing it. If a download requires a login and cannot be opened, download the file and import it.

Supported formats include PDF, ePub, Word DOCX, HTML, TXT, Markdown, JSON, and SRT, VTT, ASS, SSA, and LRC subtitle files. Convert older `.doc` files to `.docx` first.

Expand **No file yet? Try a sample** to open a local article, subtitle, or language-file sample. Importing a sample does not start translation automatically. Confirm settings, then use the same reading, proofreading, and download flow as with your own files.

## Translate and read

1. Check the language and service above the document. Use **Adjust settings** to choose languages, service, and AI model. Settings open on demand to keep the reading area clear.
2. Check the preview, then start translation.
3. Switch between original, bilingual, and translated views.

You do not wait for the whole file: each finished batch appears as soon as it returns, starting from where you are reading (the current PDF page, ePub chapter, Word part, or subtitle/JSON page). Services that accept batches receive several at once, so the whole document finishes sooner.

The sidebar lists your files and, for PDFs and for Markdown, HTML, ePub, and Word documents that have headings, an outline you can show in the original or the translation and click to jump. Markdown, plain text, and Word show each paragraph beside its translation on wide windows and below it on narrow ones.

Pause a long job if needed. Completed passages remain available after a pause or request failure; continuing processes the remainder. Changing languages, services, models, or glossary settings requires a fresh translation, with a prompt first.

Once translation finishes, the workspace focuses on reading, proofreading, and downloading. Open **Adjust settings** to retranslate, configure service connections, or replace files. Confirmation prompts protect results you have not downloaded.

## Edit and download

Open the proofreading view to search for a sentence or filter untranslated passages. Edit translations directly; your changes apply to the preview and download.

Download starts with your current bilingual or translated reading mode. Reading the original keeps the previous download choice. You can change the output in the dialog and check its filename and content preview. Binary formats show a text excerpt and retain their original format when downloaded.

Translation-only subtitle output replaces the cue text while preserving numbering, timing, and formatting tags. Bilingual output keeps both texts in each cue. Downloads include your corrections. Confirm partial downloads explicitly; untranslated or cleared passages retain the source text. Changing settings does not retranslate existing results, so downloads still use the translations currently kept on the page.

::: tip Refreshing keeps your progress
Documents, translations and edits are stored in this browser: a refresh returns to the document you were reading, and **Recent translations** on the start page restores earlier ones. Download a file when you need to keep or share it.

## PDF limits

Online and imported PDFs share the same reader. Select or copy text on the original page; translation follows your selection settings, including the icon, direct card, and keyboard shortcut. Selection uses your selection translation service, while translating the whole document uses the document translation service. Read continuously, jump to a page, or adjust zoom without translating the entire file first.

The reader prioritizes visible pages and retains canvases and text layers for at most five pages. Pages outside that window are released and rendered again when needed. Zoom keeps your current page position. Import shows downloaded bytes or parsed pages and supports cancellation and retry.

Papers, reports, slide decks exported to PDF, notes, and word-processor exports are each segmented by their own layout: text inside slide content frames and title bands is translated, and body text set at 1.5 to 2 line spacing still translates as whole paragraphs. A PDF may be up to 50 MB; other formats up to 10 MB.

Use a PDF with selectable text. Scanned PDFs are not directly recognized; convert them to a text document first, or use image translation for a few pages.

PDFs default to the **Original layout**, side by side: each translated paragraph is placed back at the position and size of its source paragraph and appears as it arrives, while waiting paragraphs show the loading style chosen in your interface settings. Formulas, figures and numeric table cells stay as they are; table headers, text cells and captions are translated. Hover a long translation to expand it; hovering also highlights the matching source paragraph (switch it off under **Translation style**). Translation starts from the page you are reading, retries automatically for up to two minutes when a service is briefly unavailable, and reports the reason if it still fails. Switch to **Reflowed text** for complete paragraphs at a fixed size. The toolbar also offers **Search** across source and translation, an **Outline** in the sidebar, and **Focus reading**.

PDF downloads paginate the full translation at a fixed font size. Bilingual output keeps each original page followed by its translated pages; original-layout output also includes a position preview. Downloaded Chinese pages remain images, so copy translation from the reader. Progress counts source pages, followed by a saving stage. Choose **Cancel export** to stop generation; translations and edits are kept for retry. The reader retains nearby pages, while export encodes and releases one output canvas at a time to control memory use.

ePub, DOCX and batch ZIP downloads show packaging progress and allow cancellation without losing translations or edits. Large JSON download previews show text excerpts while the exported file keeps its complete structure. Text download previews only encode the excerpt needed by the dialog. PDF translation appears as it progresses; other reading previews refresh after translation pauses or finishes to reduce repeated work on long documents.

## Does the file leave my computer?

The browser parses the file locally. Text to translate is sent to your selected service. Cloud translation therefore sends the relevant text outside your computer. See [Data & privacy](/en/guide/privacy).

## Translate in Obsidian

FluentRead also has an [experimental Obsidian desktop plugin](https://github.com/FluentRead/FluentRead/tree/main/integrations/obsidian). Follow the build and install instructions in its directory, then translate Markdown notes or text-based PDFs from the command palette or file context menu. The plugin saves and opens a sibling bilingual Markdown note without overwriting the source. It currently uses Microsoft Translator, which receives the text to translate. PDF output is grouped by page rather than preserving the original PDF layout.

<summary>Batch translation</summary>

## Batch translation

Select or drop multiple files, or use **Add files** in the sidebar's **Files** tab to keep existing files and translations; a newly added file becomes the current document. Confirm the service and target language, then use the batch action to translate the remaining files in order.

Each file has its own progress. An import or translation failure does not stop other files. **Pause all** preserves completed segments; starting again resumes the remaining work. If settings change, confirm restarting each partially translated file before continuing the batch, so reviewed text is not silently replaced.

When the queue stops, select a file to read, review or download it individually. Choose bilingual or translation-only output and click **Download completed files (ZIP)** to bundle completed documents. Incomplete files are excluded, and files with the same name use separate numbered folders. Switching files preserves your work; removing undownloaded translations asks for confirmation.

Files and translations are stored in this browser and can be restored from **Recent translations**; download what you need to take with you.
